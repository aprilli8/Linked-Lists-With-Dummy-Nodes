Questions (from the text):

1. The three-parameter constructor for `DoublyLinkedNodes` makes use of two `if` statements.
Suppose that you replace the calls to the constructor with the one-parameter constructor
and manually use `setNext` and `setPrevious` to set the appropriate reference.
The `if` statemenst disappear. Why?

2. The `contains` method can be written making use of the `indexOf` method, but not the other way around. Why?

3. Notice that we could have replaced the method `insertAfter` with a similar method, `insertBefore`.
This method inserts a new value before the indicated node. Some changes would have to be made to your code.
There does not appear, however, to be a choice between versions of `remove`. Why is this the case?
(Hint: Do you ever pass a dummy node to `remove`?)

4. Even though we donâ€™t need to have the special cases in, for example, the indexed version of `add`,
it is desirable to handle one or more cases in a special way. What are the cases, and why is it desirable?
