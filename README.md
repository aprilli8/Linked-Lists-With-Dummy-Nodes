# Lab 5 High-level Feedback
 * Great job! üëç Really nice commenting.
 * Consider making a helper method for code that is shared by many functions
   (aka. traversing the linked list to find a node at a particular index).
 * Remember that you can utilize insertAfter/remove(node) in your add/remove
   methods!
